My best predictions to Dare in reality Hackathon is [liner_svr_finetuned](https://github.com/k-loki/Dare-in-reality_26th-place-solution/blob/main/Svr/linear_svr_finetuned_submission_file.csv)

- The Envision racing company needs us to predict the Laptimes of racing cars
- The metric of evaluation is Root mean squared Error (rmse).

- This is a regression task and I used algorithms like support vector Machines and Random Forest regressors to make predictions.
- I dropped few features from given data to improve the model accuracy.
