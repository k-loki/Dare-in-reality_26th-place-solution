# Dare-in-reality_26th-place-solution

My best predictions to Dare in reality Hackathon is [liner_svr_finetuned](https://github.com/k-loki/Dare-in-reality_26th-place-solution/blob/main/Svr/linear_svr_finetuned_submission_file.csv)

A few key points are:

- The Envision racing company needs us to predict the Laptimes of racing cars
- The metric of evaluation is Root mean squared Error (rmse).
- This is a regression task and I used algorithms like support vector Machines and Random Forest regressors to make predictions.
- Dropping few features from given data actually increased model accuracy.

This is an intreseting competition but I didn't get to spend enough time on this.
